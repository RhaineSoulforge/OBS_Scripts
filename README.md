# OBS_Scripts
A collection of Lua scripts I use while Streaming.

DeathCounter.lua:
   This is the death counter I use when playing Souls games.  Make sure you set your file location and Hotkeys.
   Once that is complete press your Reset Hotkey to generate the counter file.
   
FortniteCount.lua:
  This is the counter I use to track victories, uncrowned and crowned, while playing Fortnite.  The file format
  is "1 (1)", where the number in the parentheses is crowned victories.  Make sure you set file location, file name, and
  Hotkeys before using.  Once setup press Reset key to generation the counter file.
